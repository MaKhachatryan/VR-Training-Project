## Overview of the VR Project

**VR-Training**: Adapting Virtual Reality Training Applications by Dynamically Adjusting Visual Aspects

**Scenario:**\
- Users move and place parcels in a VR warehouse using controllers.\
- Visual cues: dynamic lighting and color guidance.

![](VR%20Training.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Overview of the VR Project

**Motivation:**\
- Static training doesn't fit everyone: Too easy → boredom, Too hard → anxiety\
- Adaptive VR training balances difficulty to improve outcomes.

**Adaptive Features:**\
- Tracks user behavior (head movement) and performance (time, errors).\
- Adjusts lighting, object colors, etc., after each training round.

## Description of data sets

-   **Survey**: Cross-sectional study with longitudinal elements
-   **2 Cohorts: Linne and Dame**
    -   20 participants in Linne, 80 participants in Dame
    -   9 rounds of training
    -   3 groups of training versions: Adaptive, Non-Adaptive, Control
-   **Analyzed data:**
    -   Demographic data: Gender, Age, Weight, Height
    -   Stress indicators
    -   Physiological measurement data (PMD)

## Terminology

### Stress indicators:

-   Cognitive load (1 to 6 with 1 very low and 6 very high)
-   Physical load (1 to 6 with 1 very low and 6 very high)

### Physiological Measurement Data (PMD)

-   **Heart measurements:** Heart rate (HR), SDNN, RMSSD
-   **Skin conductance response (SCR) measurements:** Skin conductance level (SCL), SCR frequency, SCR amplitude, SCR rising time
-   **Eye tracking measurements:** Blink rate per minute, Saccade amplitude, Saccade velocity

## Analytical questions

1.  Are there differences between the 2 data cohorts, Linne and Dame?
2.  How are the stress indicators and the physiological measurements related?
3.  Does this correlation change over the rounds?
4.  Are there subgroups within the test subjects that stand out from the rest?

[Heart rate variability (HRV) is the change in the time between heartbeats, showing how the body manages stress. It is measured using RMSSD, a value that reflects the calming activity of the nervous system. The plot shows that as cognitive load increases, RMSSD decreases, meaning HRV drops, with higher HRV (above the 0.9 quantile) linked to better stress management.]{style="font-size:18px;"}

**3. Summary**

## Summary

-   The 2 cohorts' key characteristics are similar enough to be combined for meaningful analysis.
-   The relationships between Stress indicators and PMD is very weak (Correlation range: -0.15 to 0.1)
-   These relationships show minimal change over the rounds with no consistent patterns (Correlation range: -0.2 to 0.2)
-   Certain subgroups within the cohorts show distinct patterns of behavior when comparing PMD with stress indicators, along with a few prominent outliers.
