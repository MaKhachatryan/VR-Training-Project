3\. Summary

## 1. Overview about the VR-Project

### **General Information**

-   Title: Adapting Virtual Reality Training Applications by Dynamically Adjusting Visual Aspects\
-   Author: Fabio Genz, Dieter Kranzlmüller

### **Motivation**

-   Static training programs may not suit all users
    -   Too easy =\> boredom
    -   Too difficult =\> anxiety\
-   Adaptive VR training systems can balance difficulty to maintain engagement and improve learning outcomes.

## 1. Overview about the VR-Project

### **Training scenario:**

Users move, pick, and place parcels using VR controllers in a VR warehouse with dynamic lighting and colour guidance.

### **Adaptive System Features**

-   Use user behavior (head position, orientation) and performance (time, errors) for adjustments.
-   Adjustments: lighting intensity, object colour,...
-   Adjusts after each training round based on behaviour and performance changes.
