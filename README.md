## General instruction

This is the repository for the VR-Training Project. Please read these instructions carefully to ensure optimal program performance before running the code.

We use R version 4.3.2. Some of the packages in this project may require the latest version of R, so please ensure it is installed before proceeding.

## Usage

Please make sure to source the files in the following order:

1.  "environmentSetup.R" : This will install all the necessary packages, import the required function and data sets to run the program.
2.  ""

## Directory structure

### Root directory

-   README.md
-   Files for the Presentation:
    -   presentation.qmd
    -   presentation.html
    -   customstyle.css: Used for customizing the style in the presentation.
    -   LMULogo.jpg: Logo used in the presentation.

### Script

All the files in this directory are R scripts containing general functions essential for running the program. These include tasks like cleaning and preparing datasets, creating tables data frames for further analysis.

### Analysis

All the files in this directory are R scripts containing further analysis based on the processed data and tables. These include tasks like producing and exporting plots and visualization.

### Result

All the files in this directory are images under png format. These are the exported plots and visualization that are created in Analysis. Due to the requirements of the project, especially to analyse the subgroups' behavior and the comparison between two cohorts, we have to create as many plots as possible to be able to compare them and draw the final decision in choosing which plots are important enough to put in the presentation and the final report. Therefore a lot of plots in this directory do not appear in the presentation and the final report.
